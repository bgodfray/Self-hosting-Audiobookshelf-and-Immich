## Oracle Cloud — Setup Guide

Goal: create an always free Oracle Cloud VM suitable for hosting Audiobookshelf + Immich and prepare for Hetzner/remote object storage.

* Oracle Cloud Free Tier gives a Free Trial with US$300 credits for 30 days and a set of Always Free resources that do not expire. 
* Ampere (ARM) A1 instances available that are effectively 4 OCPUs + 24 GB RAM (useful to run media/photo processing). 
* Always Free block storage: 200 GB total (boot + block volumes combined). 
* Network: 10 TB per month outbound data transfer allowance (per originating region). 

Important: These limits and offerings are published by Oracle and may change — always check Oracle’s official Free Tier page if in doubt. [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)

## Region & Tenancy Considerations (Region Lock Warning)
Choose a region near your storage for my situation where Hetzner is in Germany then Frankfurt is a good choice for low latency.
